# P2P Project Instructions

To start the peer to peer network please follow the steps provided below:
1. Ensure that the src folder contains the correct Common.cfg and PeerInfo.cfg files.
2. Ensure that the peer_1001 directory contains the file you want to download and that the name and size of this file match that found inside the Common.cfg file.
3. Once inside the src directory run the `$ javac peerProcess.java` command to initiate the java classes. 
3. Afterwards, run the `$ java peerProcess [Peer ID]` for each of the subsequent peers in the network. 
4. Once all peers have downloaded the file, all other peers would have created new directories that contain this file and the program will stop.
